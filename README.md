This project is evolving as I grow in my red teaming skills and documentation methods.

This project explores conversational red teaming â€” the practice of psychologically and linguistically probing AI systems to identify weak points in reasoning, emotional simulation, and alignment framing. Inspired by social engineering and adversarial testing, the goal is not to cause harm, but to strengthen future systems through intelligent critique


I'm a 17 year old guy from sweden who breaks bots in his freetime. I want to become a conversational Red Teamer and I post all the documents of the bots I've broken here. 
Happy to get feedback or any tips as I got no connections in the IT world or anyhting. 
Otherwise feel free to take a look at the bots I've broken :)
