# 🧠 Conversational Red Teaming Casebook

Welcome to my personal casebook for testing and breaking AI chatbots through **language, logic, and psychological tactics** — no coding or jailbreaks involved.

I specialize in a form of behavioral red teaming where I test the limits, ethics, and reasoning of language models through conversation alone.

## 🧪 What You'll Find Here

Each folder documents a different AI chatbot I’ve tested, including:

- 🧠 **Tactics used** (social pressure, framing, value baiting, contradictions)
- 🗣️ **Conversation logs** or notes on behavior
- 📷 **Screenshots** as proof of failures or successful manipulation
- 📝 Reflections on how the bot handled edge cases

This is a living research project built from my passion for AI safety and conversational behavior.

## 🧍 About Me

I’m a 17-year-old trucking student in Sweden. I started doing this for fun, and now treat it as serious behavioral testing. I don’t know how to code (yet), but I know how to push chatbots until they show cracks.

If you're a researcher, developer, or AI safety professional — feel free to reach out or send me bots to test.
