I'm a 17 year old guy from sweden who breaks bots in his freetime. I want to become a conversational Red Teamer and I post all the documents of the bots I've broken here. 
Happy to get feedback or any tips as I got no connections in the IT world or anyhting. 
Otherwise feel free to take a look at the bots I've broken :)
